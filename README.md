## Shuffl3
A clean and minimal web-app to shuffle a list of names randomly

## How does it load so fast?
The file size is 4.0K and as you can see, sending few bytes is quite fast

## How can it be so small?
This does not use any modern shit like frameworks or anything just vanilla (and pure) html, css and javascript. No room for bloat.  
Peak internet from around 2000.
